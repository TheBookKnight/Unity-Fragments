# Unity Fragments

A library of reusable Unity building blocks for rapid game development and prototyping.

## Overview
Unity Fragments provides modular, ready-to-use systems for common game features. Whether you're building a new project or want to speed up prototyping, this repo helps you avoid reinventing the wheel for:
- Dialogue systems (branching, moral choices)
- NPC movement and AI
- Inventory management
- Save/load functionality
- Other core gameplay systems

## Why Use Unity Fragments?
- **Plug-and-Play:** Copy components into your own Unity project and customize as needed.
- **Consistent Architecture:** All systems follow best practices (e.g., ScriptableObjects for data, event-driven UI) for easy integration and extension.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly test ideas and mechanics without building everything from scratch.
- **Skill Showcase:** Well-documented, modular code demonstrates game dev fundamentals and reusability.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Copy the desired system(s) from `Assets/` into your Unity project.
3. Follow the documentation in each system folder for setup and usage.

## Example Use Cases
- Add a dialogue system for branching conversations and moral choices.
- Implement NPC movement for characters like monks or guards.
- Integrate inventory for items, relics, or data fragments.
